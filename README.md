**P300 based EEG signal processing**<br/>
P300 refers to a positive event-related potential (ERP) component that typically occurs around 300 milliseconds after the presentation of a rare or significant stimulus, such as an unexpected sound or visual cue. The P300 component is often associated with cognitive processes related to attention, memory, and decision-making. The P300 is commonly seen at centro-parietal scalp locations, with the highest amplitude usually found over parietal regions like Pz (midline parietal), and occasionally at frontal electrode sites.


**Oddball Paradigm:**
| Paradigm Type               | Description                                                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Standard Oddball Paradigm  | Basic oddball paradigm where participants are presented with standard stimuli interspersed with infrequent deviant stimuli.                      |
| Frequency Oddball Paradigm | Deviant stimuli are presented with different frequencies, allowing the investigation of how the brain processes stimuli of varying rarity.        |
| Duration Oddball Paradigm  | Deviant stimuli vary in duration compared to standard stimuli, useful for studying temporal processing and duration discrimination.              |
| Spatial Oddball Paradigm   | Deviant stimuli are presented in different spatial locations than standard stimuli, facilitating the study of spatial attention and processing. |
| Feature Oddball Paradigm   | Deviant stimuli differ from standard stimuli in perceptual features like color, shape, or orientation, useful for studying perceptual discrimination. |
| Semantic Oddball Paradigm  | Deviant stimuli differ from standard stimuli in semantic content or meaning, commonly used to study semantic processing and language comprehension.   |
