**P300 based EEG signal processing**<br/>
P300 refers to a positive event-related potential (ERP) component that typically occurs around 300 milliseconds after the presentation of a rare or significant stimulus, such as an unexpected sound or visual cue. The P300 component is often associated with cognitive processes related to attention, memory, and decision-making.
